# Component Library Guidelines

This document outlines patterns, conventions, and examples for the reusable component library under `src/app/components`.

- Components are organized by category following Atomic Design principles.
- All components use TypeScript for type safety and TailwindCSS for styling.
- Framer Motion powers animations where applicable.
- Accessibility is considered with appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard support.
- Tests live alongside components in `__tests__` folders and use Jest with React Testing Library.
- Storybook stories showcase variants and allow for interactive controls.

Implementations may be extended as needed to fit project requirements.
